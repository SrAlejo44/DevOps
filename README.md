# Hi There 👋
My name is David Alejandro, I’m preparing myself to be a DevOps engineer and study every day about different topics that could be interesting to you🧐. I’ll try to be the clearest possible in each topic and let the bibliography if you want to search.

## What is DevOps?
There are a lot of definitions about what is DevOps, but for me and what I have been researching it is a culture that starts with the objective to break the Wall between Developers and Operators but now DevOps is a methodology of work that we can use in all the product cycle to make faster and complete deployments, where we do guidelines to make a control about how we are progressing and where we can do better.

## C.A.L.M.S. Framework
The CALMS framework is where we can see the DevOps culture in a more clear form.
1. Culture 📖
   - Responsability End to End.
   - Colaboration.
   - Continuous improvement.
   - Automation
   - Fault acceptance
   - Unite teams and experiences
2. Automation 🤖
   - Eliminate manual processes.
   - Eliminate repetitive processes.
   - Everything as a code.
   - Continuous Delivery.
   - Toil concept.
3. Lean 🚮
   - Limit the accumulation of waste.
   - Limit the WIP (Work in process)
   - Reduce the size of gaps.
   - Reduce the number of handoffs.
   - Identify the restrictions and concerns.
   - Eliminate all the wast of our value flow.
4. Measurement 📏
	- LeadTime: When the ticket is created until it ends.
	- Process time: When the ticket started until I finished it.
	- Change Frequency: How frequent are the changes.
	- Change Failure Rate: Failure rate.
   - MTTR: Mean time to repair (How long it takes us to solve the problems).
5. Sharing 🗣
	- Break down silos to share between different areas.
	- Share knowledge
	- Better practices
   - Processes
